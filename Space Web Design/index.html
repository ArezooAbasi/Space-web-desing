                    Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events
                    have relative position and direction. In classical physics, physical 
                    space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists
                    usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional 
                    continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of 
                    fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However,
                    disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity,
                    a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.
